# First Five — Application API

All routes are JSON. Builder routes use the `ff_session` cookie. Errors: `{ "error": { "code", "message", "fields?" } }`.
SDK endpoints are specified separately in [SDK_INTEGRATION.md](../integrations/SDK_INTEGRATION.md) and [sdk-openapi.yaml](sdk-openapi.yaml).

## Health
| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/healthz` | Process up |
| GET | `/readyz` | Database reachable (503 otherwise) |

## Auth & access
| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/signup` | `{ email, password, name?, invitationCode? }` → 201, sets cookie. **No access is granted at signup.** |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | 10 / 15 min per IP+email |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | User + entitlement (`status: none|active`, study credits, usage) |
| PATCH | `/api/account` | `{ name }` |
| POST | `/api/access/redeem` | `{ code }` — atomic, audited; grants the code's study credits |
| GET | `/api/billing/offer` | ₹99 single-study offer; `checkoutAvailable` false unless `PAYMENTS_ENABLED=true` AND Pine Labs implemented + configured |
| POST | `/api/payments/checkout` | 503 `payment_unavailable` while checkout is closed |

| POST | `/api/events` | Allowlisted client funnel events (`landing_page_viewed`, `paid_cta_clicked`, `waitlist_cta_clicked`, `access_page_viewed`) |

All workspace routes (`/api/projects…`, `/api/studies…`, `/api/reports…`, `/api/sessions…`) return **403 `no_entitlement`** for accounts that have never received a paid or complimentary grant. Accounts whose credits are used up keep read access to their work.
